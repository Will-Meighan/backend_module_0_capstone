## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

Conditional statements are questions within a block that evaluate to true or false, indicating what should be printed.

==  This conditional statement is asking if two values are equal to each other
<  Asking if the first listed value is less than the second listed values
<=  Asking if the first value is less than or equal to second listed value


1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

We would use an if statement if there are seperate possible printed answers based off the criteria of a conditional statement.


1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if conditional [then]
  code
elsif conditional [then]
  code
else
  code
end


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

See above answer; You will add elsif or else conditionals


1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

See above.


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

We could possibly use switch-statements, which allow for more readable code, as these conditional statements can get a bit messy. Additionally, when checking to see if an expression evaluates as true, we could also loop to repeat the execution of the code.
