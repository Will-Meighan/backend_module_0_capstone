## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

Conditional statements are questions within a block that evaluate to true or false, indicating what should be printed.

==  This conditional statement is asking if two values are equal to each other
<  Asking if the first listed value is less than the second listed values
<=  Asking if the first value is less than or equal to second listed value

We would use an if statement if there are seperate possible printed answers based off the criteria of a conditional statement.

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
